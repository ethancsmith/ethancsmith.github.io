I am a professor of mathematics at Grove City College.
My mathematical interests are rooted in number theory, though I find myself increasingly interested in all areas of mathematical science.  
My favorite theorem is the [Chebotar&euml;v Density Theorem](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/ChebotarevDensityTheorem.html).
For a very nice exposition of this theorem, see the article [Chebotar&euml;v and his Density Theorem](http://websites.math.leidenuniv.nl/algebra/chebotarev.pdf) by P. Stevenhagen and H.W. Lenstra, Jr.
